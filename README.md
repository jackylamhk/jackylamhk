As a DevOps & Backend Engineer at Greenfly, I own the deployment and testing pipelines and manage cloud infrastructure on AWS. I have over six years of experience in DevOps, SWE, SecOps, and IT Ops; I am also a certified expert by AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle, ISC2, Linux Foundation, GitHub, and CompTIA.

Before Greenfly, I was a System and DevOps Engineer at Coherent. I implemented high-availability solutions with Kubernetes and AWS Lambda, set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and managed Keycloak, a Red Hat multi-tenant IAM service.

I am passionate about designing secure, performant, highly available, cost-effective cloud architectures and promoting the DevOps culture to meet business needs and maximize operational efficiency. I am proficient in Python, JavaScript, PHP, Bash, and PowerShell.

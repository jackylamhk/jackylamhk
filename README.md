As a DevOps & Backend Enginner at Greenfly, I own the deployment and testing pipelines, and manage cloud infrastructure on AWS. I have over six years of experience in DevOps, SecOps, and IT Ops, and I hold multiple expert-level certifications from AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle, ISC2, and CompTIA.

Prior to Greenfly, I was a System Administrator at Coherent. I implemented high-availability solutions with Kubernetes and AWS Lambda, set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and managed Keycloak, a Red Hat multi-tenant IAM service.

I am passionate about delivering secure, efficient cloud architectural services to meet business needs and enhance operational efficiency. I am also skilled in writing Python, JavaScript, and Bash scripts for automation and integrations.As a DevOps & Backend Enginner at Greenfly, I own the deployment and testing pipelines, and manage cloud infrastructure on AWS.

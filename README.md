As a DevOps & Backend Engineer at Greenfly, I own the deployment and testing pipelines and manage cloud infrastructure on AWS. I have over six years of experience in DevOps, SecOps, and IT Ops, and I hold multiple expert-level certifications from AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle, ISC2, and CompTIA. I am also an avid open-source software contributor.

Before Greenfly, I was a System Administrator at Coherent. I implemented high-availability solutions with Kubernetes and AWS Lambda, set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and managed Keycloak, a Red Hat multi-tenant IAM service.

I am passionate about designing secure, performant, highly available, cost-effective cloud architectures and promoting the DevOps culture to meet business needs and boost operational efficiency. I am also proficient in Python, JavaScript, PHP, PowerShell, and Bash.

Despite the top languages chart displayed, I mainly write in Python. Charts last updated Dec 2023.

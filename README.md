As an IT Support Specialist at Coherent, I administer multiple platforms, including AWS, Azure, GCP, M355, Entra ID, Atlassian, Google Workspace, and more. I oversee company-wide Identity and Access Management (IAM), including managing user-provisioning cycles and role-based access control (RBAC). I am also well-versed in writing Python, JavaScript, and Bash.

I possess sought-after credentials from AWS, Microsoft, ISC2, and CompTIA, and I am proficient in IT service management, cloud infrastructure, business process automation, and enterprise security management. I am deeply committed to maintaining operational efficiency and delivering superior systems administration services to meet business needs.
